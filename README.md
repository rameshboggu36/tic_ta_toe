# Tic Tac Toe Game 

Created a Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In this project, to find the winning combination, I have used an array of all the winning combinations and checked, also included a restart button.


You can find web page for tic-tac-toe game here:

Here you can see how the web page of tic tac toe game looks like:

When a Player wins this is how the message is displayed:

<img src="images/winning.png" height="150">

When no player wins, this is how the message is displayed:

<img src="images/draw.png" height="150">

Along with these, I have added some additional features like:
1. When a player wins, the remaining blocks were disabled to click.

2. When the restart button is clicked, all the cells will be emptied.
